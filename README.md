## Questions:

### Q-1: Add at least 3 Project features

    1. An already selected item cannot be selected again.  
    2. Can not select more than 20 credits of item.  
    3. Once the credit reached 0, a warning toast was shown.

### Q-2: Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project

Ans: I managed the state using the react hook useState(). For example, when clicked, the Select button updated the course name list using the state update function named setListName. I also updated the price and remaining hour using the same useState() hook and updated their values on each click using the state update function.
